# HTTP: POST


The purpose of this dapp is to give developers a minimal dapp that uses the IC's HTTPS outcalls feature to make a `POST` request.



If you want to start working on your project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
clone this repo
cd folder name
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test your project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
dfx deploy
```
